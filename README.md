MUNet: Macro Unit-based Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Devices

#### Dependencies

 * Python 3.5+
 * Tensorflow 1.2.0+ (tested upto version 1.14)
 * Keras 2.0.6+ (tested upto version 2.2.4)
 
#### Usage
 1. Cloning the repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kdhht2334/MUNet-CVPR18-Workshop.git
$ cd MUNET-CVPR18-Workshop/
```

 2. Run

```
$ python main.py --gpus gpu-id
```
For example, gpu-id is from 0 to 3 in case of 4GPUs device.

If you use 1GPU device, then gpu-id is 0.
